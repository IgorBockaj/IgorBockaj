Hi, Iâ€™m @IgorBockajðŸ‘‹ 
   
   Iâ€™m interested in Web Development and learning new things. I like new challenges and that is one of the reasons why I started learning programming in the first place ðŸ˜€. 
   Currently I'm learning ReactJS, but I'd like to learn as much Javascript stack as possible. I'd like to get a job in Web Development Industry because I believe it would help
   me to get exprrience faster. 
   Feel free to check out my work, there isn't a lot of repositories, but im working on it ðŸ˜‰
   
   You can email me on igorbockaj268@gmail.com
